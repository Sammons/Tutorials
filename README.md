Sequential Execution - Node.js Tut.
=========

Note that this is the stage 2 code version.

Sometimes with node you will have a series of things you want to have happen, but you are having difficulties with the async nature of node.js.

Supplies needed:

*	node.js!
*	request Module (`npm install request`)
*	fs module      (core package, no install needed)

or just run `npm install`
